# Coding 2D Cookbook
A collection of small programs, each demonstrating a specific programming concept. Each example is self-contained, and the only external library used is PixiJS, which handles the rendering and drawing.

## Why?
* Share knowledge with others.
* Learn topics that interest me.
* Build up knowledge incrementally.
* Create a personal library of reference material in my own style.
* Find answers faster than searching documentation or Stack Overflow.
* Explore new concepts.
