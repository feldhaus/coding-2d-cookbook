# Coding 2D Cookbook

A collection of small, self-contained programs designed to demonstrate specific programming concepts. Each example leverages **PixiJS** for rendering and drawing, ensuring a focus on the concepts rather than boilerplate code.

## Additional Libraries

This project also showcases the use of the following libraries created by me:

- [@feldhaus/math](https://github.com/feldhaus/math)
- [@feldhaus/vector](https://github.com/feldhaus/vector)

## Why This Exists

This project serves multiple purposes:

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Share programming insights with others in an accessible format.
- **Personal Growth:** Explore topics that interest me and learn by doing.
- **Incremental Learning:** Build a solid knowledge base step by step.
- **Quick Reference:** Create a personal library for faster solutions, avoiding long searches through documentation or forums.
- **Experimentation:** Dive into new programming concepts with a hands-on approach.

## Features

- **Self-Contained Examples:** Each program focuses on a single concept, making it easy to understand and reuse.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Uses only **PixiJS** for rendering and **CodeMirror** for code editing (where applicable).
